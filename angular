Angular

Modularity
Isolation
Component structure
React is a library and angular is a ramework
Rest Template is used to interact btw 2 java program using rest.
Angular follows component/Modules based architecture.
Modules comprises of components(will does only one task)
In angular we have HTML+CSS+JS together as a componenet and multiple component is module.

ng new projectName
ng serve
ng g c test  // g for generate and c for component
lsof -i:8080  //To see the PID of the port
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:4201) //

                                                               SELECTOR

We can also use selector as a class by using .app-test   in .ts file
And where you want to call the component use <div class="app-test">
We can also use in square bracket and directly use selector name in div tag

HOW TO USE INLINE TEMPLATES
just use template and style instead of templateURL and styleURL
Use backticks(`) instead of single qoutes

                                                              INTERPOLATION
We can bind data from class to template..

 template: `<div>   
             Welcome {{name}} to inline HTML
             
             </div>`,
  styleUrls: ['./binding-component.component.css']
})
export class BindingComponentComponent implements OnInit {
  
  public name ="AbhishekSingh";
